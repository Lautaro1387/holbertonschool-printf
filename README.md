Project: C - printf
The "printf" function mirrors the functionalities of the printf function found in the C library, in this case we use these conversion specifiers: c, s, %, d and i.

For example
#include "main.h"
_printf("I get up every day at %d in the morning and go to %s"., 6, "work");

Print this:
I get up every day at 6 in the morning and go to work.
