# Project: C - printf
The "printf" function mirrors the functionalities of the printf function found in the C library included in the stdio.h file, in this case we use these conversion specifiers: c, s, %, d and i.

# For example
#include "main.h"
_printf("I get up every day at %d in the morning and go to %s"., 6, "work");

Print this:
I get up every day at 6 in the morning and go to work.

# Specifiers characteres:
| Specifier | Character |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|  %c  |  Character  |
|  %s  | String of character  |
|  %  |  Followed by a %, prints another %  |
|  %d  |  Decimal  |
|  %i  |  Integer  |
